This project is a website for a restauarant, it showcases the restaurant menu, team, awards and allows the user to book a table.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [HTML] 
    - The project uses

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


HTML - This was used to form the basic undecorated structure of the site. Implemented using html was all text, images, and basic structural layout.
CSS - Css was used to decorate the site. This includes putting headers in the middle of the page, colouring backgrounds on the Carousel and footer , adding font sizes to the text and decorating the images with the border-radius style as just some examples.
JavaScript - The modal used on the lessons page and taken from bootstrap ver. 4.3 uses Javasript.
Bootstrap - Bootstrap vesion 4.3 was used in this site. This is a library to get ready made code that can be copy and pasted into ones own project. The code was then styled using my own CSS styling. The page is available here Link to Bootstrap version 4.3
Google Fonts - This site was used to get the two font styles used in this project. Link to Google Fonts
Font Awesome - This website provided the social media icons in the footer of my page. Link to Font Awesome
Balsamiq - This site was used to create the wireframes from which I structured the look of the finished site. Link to Balsamiq
Github - This site was used as a repository for updates to the progress of the site. Link to Github pages
Git - This was used to record progress on the site via commits. These commits were then pushed to Github for a more concrete repository of the work.
Gitpod - This is the editor used to code with. Link to Gitpod


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
